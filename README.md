# algos
The objective of this project is to create an application that will enable us to convert computer algorithms written in English language into a computer program. Simple algorithms will be processed by the application and will be converted into a program written in any desired programming language. For any algorithm, there will be a set of programming languages, into which that algorithm can be converted, user may select any desired language out of them, and algorithm will be processed accordingly. After creating basic modules for all languages, we will develop a module that will enable us to create or manage algorithms using graphical notations.
